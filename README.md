This is an input-output extension of a Lindblad equation modeling a two level system coupled to a 1-dimensional Markovian bath at zero temperature.
It constitutes a specific case of the more general [input-output Hierarchical Equations of Motion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12221).

This input-output Lindblad equation is designed to probe the occupation of a Markovian zero-temperature environment initially prepared with a 1-photon wave-packet propagating towards the two-level system. 
Specifically, the code computes the occupation density for the modes along the 1-dimensional environment and the reduced system dynamics and compares it with the analytical result.
